2. Exploration process, encountered anomalies, devised solutions, and an analytical review of the algorithms’ efficiency in galactic-scale applications.
- For finding the longest shortest path (diameter) from the given data file, I first use open function to read the given data file. After that,
I utilize Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, which is one of the main algorithms for finding shortest paths btween all pairs of nodes. For this algorithm I follow the process, 
first I initialize distance matrix from every node to every other node. Then, I load the direct weights into the matrix. Then, using a triple loop, I check if a 
shorter path could be found via an intermediate node k, if yes, then I update the distance. Following the algorithm, I use the resulting matrix to calculate the 
diameter by iterating over all start and end nodes to check if the new distance was larger than the current diameter (ignoring infinity).
- Time complexity of this algorithm can be calculated as follows:
    - Reading a file takes O(E), because it takes linear time, where E is the number of lines (edges).
    - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm takes O(V^3) because it involves three nested for loops that iterate through the nodes of the graph (k,i,j).
    - Finding the diameter takes O(V^2) because it involves two nested loops that iterate through every source (u) and every destination (v)
    in the computed distance matrix to identify the maximum value.
    - The total complexity for the algorithm is O(V^3) because O(V^3) grows much faster than O(E) and O(V^2)
