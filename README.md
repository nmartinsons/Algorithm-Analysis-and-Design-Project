# Algorithm Analysis and Design Project - Intergalactic Graph Algorithms Expedition

### Problems solved:

- Quantum Minimum Spanning Tree (QMST): Harness quantum algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) of the galaxy's communication network, ensuring efficient data transmission across space stations. Submit the total weights of the tree as text and the tree as a file. For purposes of this assignment we use hyperflow (which is directional).
- Hyperflow Maximization: Utilize advanced algorithms to optimize the flow of hypermatter Spice through the galaxy's trade routes, maximizing efficiency from the source planet to the sink colony. So for this task calculate maximum flow from Earth to Betelgeuse . Submit flow value as text and actual flow graph as file.
- Cosmic Diameter Calculation: Determine the diameter of the galactic web, defined as the longest shortest path between any two wormholes, to aid in the rapid deployment of defense mechanisms against cosmic threats. Submit the diameter, and submit the path of this longest diameter as file. We use weights for this just like other tasks not hops.
