1. Total Maximum Hyperflow from Earth to Betelgeuse: 252.0.
2. Exploration process, encountered anomalies, devised solutions, and an analytical review of the algorithms’ efficiency in galactic-scale applications:
- For finding the max flow from the given data file, I first use with open function to read the given data file. After that,
I utilize Edmonds–Karp Algorithm, which is one of the algorithms for finding max flow from source to sink. The path that is found is the shortest path that has 
available capacity using BFS. I choose it over Ford-Fulkerson method because Edmonds-Karp uses BFS to find the shortest augmenting path 
(fewest hops) rather than just any path. For this algorithm I follow the process, first using the BFS, which I use for checking if the node has been visited and it has 
available capacity. In addition, I use a residual graph. This structure tracks not only the remaining capacity but also creates 'reverse edges,' which allows for the 
algorithm to virtually 'undo' suboptimal flow allocations and reroute them.

- Time complexity of this algorithm can be calculated as follows:
    - Reading a file takes O(E), because it takes linear time, where E is the number of lines (edges).
    - BFS gives O(E+V), but since E dominate and flow networks are connected, it gives O(E).
    - Since Edmonds–Karp Algorithm uses two nested while loops it gives us O(E*V)
    - The total gives us O(V) * O(E*V) = O(E*V^2).
